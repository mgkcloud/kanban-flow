# Overview  
Kanban Flow is a modern web-based kanban board application for task management. It provides users with a visual, intuitive way to organize, prioritize, and track tasks through a customizable workflow. The application caters to individuals, teams, and organizations seeking to improve productivity and workflow management through the kanban methodology.

# Core Features  
## Task Management
- Create, edit, and delete tasks with various properties (title, description, due date, priority, labels, etc.)
- Move tasks between columns representing different workflow stages via drag-and-drop
- Filter and search tasks based on properties, assignees, or other metadata

## Board Customization
- Create and manage multiple kanban boards for different projects or workflows
- Add, rename, reorder, and remove columns to match specific workflow needs
- Customize column limits to prevent workflow bottlenecks
- Apply color coding and visual indicators for task status, priority, and deadlines

## User Authentication
- Secure user registration and login
- Role-based access control for boards and tasks
- User profile management and personalization

## Team Collaboration
- Task assignment to team members
- Comments and activity tracking on tasks
- Real-time updates and notifications

# User Experience  
## User Personas
- Individual users seeking personal task management
- Team leads managing project workflows
- Organizations implementing kanban methodology across departments

## Key User Flows
- Signing up and creating a first board
- Adding tasks and organizing them into columns
- Dragging and dropping tasks between columns
- Collaborating with team members on shared boards
- Filtering and searching for specific tasks

## UI/UX Considerations
- Clean, intuitive interface with minimal learning curve
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile use
- Accessibility for all users
- Visual indicators for task status, priorities, and deadlines
- Smooth animations for drag-and-drop and board updates

# Technical Architecture  
## Frontend
- React as the primary UI library with TypeScript for type safety
- Next.js for server-side rendering, routing, and API routes
- Tailwind CSS for styling with a custom design system
- React DnD or react-beautiful-dnd for drag-and-drop functionality
- Client-side state management using React Context API or Redux
- Form handling with React Hook Form

## Backend
- Next.js API routes for server-side logic
- Supabase for database, authentication, and real-time updates
- Clerk for enhanced authentication features
- RESTful API design with proper error handling and validation

## Data Models
- Users: User profiles and authentication data
- Boards: Collection of columns and tasks with metadata
- Columns: Workflow stages within a board
- Tasks: Individual items with properties, comments, and history
- Comments: User feedback and notes attached to tasks
- Activities: Audit log of actions for tracking changes

## Integrations
- Email notifications for task assignments and updates
- Export functionality for reports and data backup
- Webhooks for third-party integrations (future)

# Development Roadmap  
## Phase 1: Core Functionality (MVP)
- User authentication with Clerk
- Basic board creation and management
- Column customization
- Task creation, editing, and deletion
- Drag-and-drop functionality for moving tasks
- Basic user profile management

## Phase 2: Enhanced Collaboration
- Task assignment to users
- Comments on tasks
- Activity tracking and history
- Notifications system
- Board sharing and team management

## Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Custom fields for tasks
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- Board templates
- Swimlanes and WIP limits
- Analytics and reporting
- Mobile optimization

## Phase 4: Integrations and Extensions
- External calendar integration
- Email/Slack notifications
- Import/export functionality
- API for third-party extensions
- Automation rules for task movement

# Logical Dependency Chain
1. Setup project structure and authentication
2. Implement basic board and column management
3. Create task CRUD operations
4. Implement drag-and-drop functionality
5. Add user profiles and basic settings
6. Implement task details and properties
7. Add collaboration features
8. Develop notification system
9. Implement advanced filtering and search
10. Add analytics and reporting features

# Risks and Mitigations  
## Technical Challenges
- **Risk**: Performance issues with large boards and many tasks
  **Mitigation**: Implement virtualization and pagination for task lists

- **Risk**: Real-time synchronization conflicts
  **Mitigation**: Implement proper conflict resolution and optimistic UI updates

- **Risk**: Mobile usability with drag-and-drop
  **Mitigation**: Design mobile-specific interactions for task movement

## MVP Scope
- **Risk**: Feature creep extending development timeline
  **Mitigation**: Strict prioritization of MVP features and incremental delivery

- **Risk**: Overengineering simple features
  **Mitigation**: Focus on user needs and iterate based on feedback

## Resource Constraints
- **Risk**: Limited development resources
  **Mitigation**: Leverage existing libraries and components when possible

- **Risk**: UX design complexity
  **Mitigation**: Start with standard patterns and refine based on user testing
